CS 1571 Homework 1 Readme

I wrote this homework assignment 2.7.10 and should work on any version of python 2.

The libraries that I used were the Queue, ast, collections and math libraries.
All of these are included in the python 2 standard library, and therefore no additional installations should be required.

I used this webpage as a starting point for the uninformed search strategies, and from there modified them to suit the problems.

I spoke with Ryan Yoder and Paul Davis about the asssignment. For the most part, we talked about implementation details and worked
together to debug issues that we were having.
